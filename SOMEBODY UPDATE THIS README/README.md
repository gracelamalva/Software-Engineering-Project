# App-Promoting-Mental-Health-1156
### Description

[Title] is a web application that helps promote mental health awareness. There are two parts to this app. One aspect is the journals where users and patients can create an account and write their thoughts in a web journal. The journal also has a feature that tracks users good or bad days through a sentiment analysis and allows them to see their overall progress on a calendar. However, the main feature is the chat-box AI that acts like a therapist and allows users and patients to talk to the chat-box whenever they want to. There is a difference between users and patients because with this app, patients have the ability to locate a therapist outside the web application.
