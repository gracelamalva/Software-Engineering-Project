####  Directory Information - deliverables folder

The purpose of this folder is to include all the project deliverables requested by your instructor. In this folder, you will be requested to submit the various deliverables of the project. Each deliverable will be in its own subfolder, under this folder. For example, for the first deliverable you will be asked to create a folder called `D01_initial_backlog` and within it you will add all resource files associated with that deliverable.
