####  Directory Information - use_cases_docs
The purpose of this folder is to include all resoures associated with each use-case. Each use-case will have its own sub-folder (for example, `use-case_001`, `use-case_002`, `use-case_003`, etc.). For each use case, the instructor will specify the format of each deliverable you must include.
