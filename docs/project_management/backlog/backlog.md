**Shipping Module**
- ID:001, **Use-case: Create Journal, Create Entry, Modify Entry, Delete Entry**
  - _Description_: Creates a journal for the user to enter in entries daily. The user logs in and then by default users have a journal. This feature will be implemented using a database that creates a new table that allows the user to create a new entry. Users can create multiple journals. The database saves each journal entry and each user has their own specific table in the database; it is created once the user makes a new entry. Users can create multiple entries, modify their entries and delete their entries, which will be reflected in the backend. We are planning on creating the backend and database for this feature and a frontend of how it will look from the user's perspective when they create a journal entry. Refer to the other use cases that specify how to create an entry, modify an entry and delete an entry.

- ID:002, **Use-case: Analyzing Journal Entries**
